# Conway's game of life made in C and MPI

# Description
I took a class on distributed computing where one of our projects was to build Conway's game of life.
This is not the most clean code but it does the job.

# Differences in the versions
Vanilla: The base code for Conway's game of life.
WithTiming: I added the timing so I record how long it took to run.
WithTimingSubmitV1: The first version I cleaned for submit.
WithTimingAndOptionalDisplaySubmitV2: I built in the option to display the board on the screen, it's a command line argument.

# What it runs on/how to run
Ubuntu with MPI running and lunch it via the mpi commands. How to do this is dependant on your system and if you are using slurm or not.
